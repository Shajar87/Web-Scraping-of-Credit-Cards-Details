## Project: Web Scraping of Credit Cards Details 
### About The Project
**Tool used: Python and Excel**

---
In this project, I web-scraped credit cards details from the **ICICI Bank** website.
For this, I utilized the powerful **BeautifulSoup** library of Python. 
I was able to gather valuable information on various credit cards offered by ICICI Bank, including their features, benefits, and terms.

**The steps involved in this project are:**
1. Firstly, I imported the required libraries in the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Scraped card details and saved them into the Excel workbook using the **Openpyxl** library.
4. Analyzed after organizing the extracted data using Excel.
